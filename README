Virtual Function Daemon - VFD with QoS Extensions

DANGER: this branch is very unstable with QoS is enabled.  Currently it may be built with 
	DPDK 16.11, however this is soon to change.  When VFd is executed with the -q option
	(or QoS is enabled in the config file) there are likely to be bugs, and the code may
	flat out not work at present.  This branch is a live development effort to add QoS.

VFD is a daemon which is used to configures NIC PF/VFs in ways which are not possible through 
the standard ixgbe driver.

The directories here contain the VFD code and some system tools such as the iplex 
command line interface tool which is used to interact with the daemon. 


Some requirements:
	- DPDK version 16.11 (possibly with the need for special AT&T patches (https://github.com/att/dpdk))
	- Linux kernel version  3.13 or later.  (VFd may execute on earlier kernels,
	  however odd behavour has been observed with respect to packet dropping in one 
	  or both directions with seem to be related to shared memory.)
