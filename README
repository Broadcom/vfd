Virtual Function Daemon - VFD

VFD is a daemon which is used to configures NIC PF/VFs in ways which are not possible through 
the standard ixgbe driver.

The directories here contain the VFD code and some system tools such as the iplex 
command line interface tool which is used to interact with the daemon. 


Some requirements:
	- DPDK version 16.07 with special AT&T patches (https://github.com/att/dpdk)
	- Linux kernel version  3.16.0-60 or later.  (VFd will execute on earlier kernels,
	  however there will be odd behavour with respect to packet dropping in one or 
	  both directions with seem to be related to shared memory.)
