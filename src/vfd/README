This is code originally written by  "ZELEZNIAK, ALEX" <az5157@att.com>.
It provides a daemon that configures PF/VFs in ways which are not possible through 
the standard ixgbe driver.

These additional functions allow for 'QinQ' tunnelling and port mirroring.  
There are possibly others functions that it provides.

The daemon (VFD) has been extended to:
	- read single configuration files as provided by nova (future)
	- read all configuration files on restart (future)
	- read requests from a named FIFO (future)
