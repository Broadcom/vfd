This is code originally written by  "ZELEZNIAK, ALEX" <az5157@att.com>.
It provides a daemon that configures PF/VFs in ways which are not possible through 
the standard ixgbe driver.

These additional functions allow for 'QinQ' tunnelling and port mirroring.  
There are possibly others functions that it provides.
