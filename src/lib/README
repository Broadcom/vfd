Library modules 

Symtab
	Library which provides a symbol table (a.k.a. named hash or map)
	This is code I wrote, and opensourced prior to joining AT&T. A 
	dirivitive was used in Ningaui.

Jwrapper
	Library which provides a nice interface to the underlying jsmn json
	parser. Jsmn is pulled from github (mk jsmn) and built. The contents
	of the jsmn directory should NOT be checked into git.  The jsmn license
	is added to the LICENCE file in this directory per the stipulation in
	their license. 

	See jwrapper_test as an example for use.
