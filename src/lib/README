Library modules 

Symtab
	Library which provides a symbol table (a.k.a. named hash or map)
	This is code I wrote, and opensourced prior to joining AT&T. A 
	dirivitive was used in Ningaui.

Jwrapper
	Library which provides a nice interface to the underlying jsmn json
	parser. Jsmn is pulled from github (mk jsmn) and built. The contents
	of the jsmn directory should NOT be checked into git.  The jsmn license
	is added to the LICENCE file in this directory per the stipulation in
	their license. 

	See jwrapper_test as an example for use.

Config
	This contains parsers which read the various configuration files (parms
	in /etc/vfd/vfd.cfg, and vf config files written by nova). Unit tests:
		vf_config_test [config-file]
		parm_file_test [config-file]

list_files
	Simple mechanism to open a directory and build a list of the files in 
	the directory which have the supplied suffix (e.g. all .cfg files).
	Optionally, the names returned can be qualified with the path given.
	Unit test:

		list_test dir-name suffix1 [suffix2...]

fifo
	Provides support for opening and reading to a fifo (named pipe). Reads
	are _nonblocking_ (returning a zero byte buffer if nothing is available.
	The reader is configured to return 'blocks' of data from the pipe where
	a block is designated with two successive newline characters.  Unit test:
		fifo_test pipe-name


Building
	The plan-9 mk tool is sitll the preferred tool to make the library and 
	fetch/build the required jsmn repo/library.  There is a Makefile which 
	should match, but is likely untested (replace mk with gmake in the 
	example below).

	# clone the jsmn repo and build its library
	mk jsmn
	
	# build the vfd library
	mk 

DPDK Reference
	The att/dpdk library is an extended version of dpdk 1607 and can be 
	fetched from github.  The best way to reference it is to add a symlink
	to the library in this directory, e.g.: 
		ln -s <path-to-dpdk-clone> dpdk

	Once the link is in place, the code in the ../vfd library can be
	successfully built. See the README in this directory's parent for
	DPDK configuration/build notes (if needed).
