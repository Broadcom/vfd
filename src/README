This code makes use of a modified dpdk library which must be pulled from the
github:/att/dpdk repo.  The suggested method is to clone it alongside other 
repos and create a sim-link in src/lib here.   There are some includes which
must make reference to a relative path because of the way the dpdk stuff is
built via the dpdk make environment. 

Once the dpdk repo has been cloned, it must be built before anything in the 
vfd source tree can be built. To do this follow the following steps:

    -   create symlink in src/lib
	- 	cd dpdk
	-	make config T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
	-	make
	-	tools/dpdk-setup.sh 		#select option 15, it will set environment 
	-	export RTE_SDK=$PWD
	-	export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc


Todo:
	A toplevel mk/make build needs to be provided
