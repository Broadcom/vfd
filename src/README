Top level source directory.  Things which maybe aren't obvious are described
in this file.


The dpdk directory is either a symlink, or a real directory. Either 
way it references the dpdk repo clone from att-cloud.  That repo
must be cloned and built before anything in the vfd source tree can 
be done. Sadly, the implementation of the intel script requires a 
human to execute (there is a menu choice) so initially the build 
process cannot be automated without some extra effort. 

Once the repo is cloned run these:
	- 	cd dpdk
	-	make config T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
	-	make
	-	tools/setup.sh 		#select option 14, it will set environment 
	-	export RTE_SDK=$PWD
	-	export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc


Todo:
	A toplevel mk/make build needs to be provided
