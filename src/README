VFd (master branch) should now build cleanly against (and requeres) DPDK 16.11.
The usual RTE_ environment variables must be defined. 

You will need to clone the dpdk.org repo, and build that before you can build
VFd.  Once the dpdk repo has been cloned, it must be built before anything in the 
vfd source tree can be built. To do this follow the following steps:

	-   cd build            # where ever you plan to clone/build it
    -   git clone http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk   # if you need to clone 
    -   cd dpdk				# where ever you installed it
    -   git checkout v16.11
    -   make config T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
    -   make
    -   tools/dpdk-setup.sh
         + select the option which corresponds to the correct
           environment, most likely: x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
           This will go through another make process which sets
           libraries and such up. If there are link errors during
           the build, it is likely this step was not executed, or
           didn't finish correctly

    -   export RTE_SDK=$PWD
    -   export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc

Building VFd Itself
After the DPDK library has been built, you can cd into vfd/src and:
	- cd vfd    # which ever directory you cloned the vfd repo into
	- cd lib
	- make jsmn			# will clone and build the jsmn library
	- make libvfd.a		# will build vfd support library
	- cd ../vfd
	- make clean 
	- make


Todo:
	A toplevel mk/make build needs to be provided


Notes:
  - The original requirement to have a symlink to the dpdk library in the vfd
    lib directory is _no longer_ needed.

  - You should only need to rebuild the DPDK library if there are changes, 
    you switched to a different branch/tag, or you recloned the repo.
